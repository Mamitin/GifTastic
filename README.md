## Overveiw:
In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of popular athletes. I had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

## How you play the game?
- When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate.
- When the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
- Under every gif, displayed is its rating (PG, G). This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
- In the search area the user can type an athlete and hitthe submit button.
- It will make a new button with the new athletes name.
- Once the user clicks on the new button it will generate 10 new gifs of that athlete.
